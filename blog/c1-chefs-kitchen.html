    <h2><i>The social experience of DBC</i></h2>
    <h4>November 23, 2014</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Wrapped up my first week of DBC by watching a video of Shereef Bishay, co-founder of DBC, leading an online <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">“fireside chat”</a> with a group of students. In this chat Shereef gave some background information about the program and what to expect, and then opened the discussion up for a Q & A session. The students asked many of the same questions I had, in addition to several great questions that I wouldn’t have thought to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the biggest takeaway regarding the DBC experience is that I need to go into it with a creator mindset rather than a consumer mindset. This means that instead of considering the program to be a package that I have purchased, with certain outcomes expected and even owed to me because of this purchase, I need to focus on it being up to me to get everything I can out of the program by putting absolutely everything I’ve got into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While DBC teaches the technical skills needed to become a developer, it seems that the overall focus is actually on the social aspect of developing. Shereef explained that anyone can learn to code, and that what makes DBC a unique program is that their graduates have the social skills and emotional intelligence needed to be an amazing project team member. One of the main reasons I felt DBC was a good fit for me was that they put an emphasis on these non-technical skills, but I wasn’t aware of just how strong this emphasis is. It’s filled me with even more confidence that this is the right place for me. I’ve seen web teams work together and have noticed that this does in fact seem to be the key to a successful team, and knowing DBC’s co-founders have come to this same conclusion tells me I was on the right track.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I’ve seen web teams at work, I’ve only been involved on the business side (stating what we’d like to see in the final product). I have no previous programming experience, so I’m coming into this program very nervous about not being able to keep up or contribute enough. I’m more of a listener and follower, so DBC is really going to push me outside of my comfort zone…which, while difficult, I know is a good thing. I firmly believe in the saying “life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” I’m going to push myself to be more social, to speak up, and to try my hand at leading when I get the chance. I think taking the role of the navigator during pair programming will help me with this.
    </p>
    <p>This video left me feeling a little nervous, but more than that I felt determined. It’s always scary trying something new, but I’m not in this alone. My cohort is in the same boat, and I owe it to myself and to them to put everything I’ve got into this. After all, we’re talking about our futures.
